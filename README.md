# Hospital Data Analysis

This Python script is designed to analyze data from multiple CSV files containing information about patients in different hospitals. It performs various data cleaning and analysis tasks using the pandas library.

#### The code answers the following questions:

- Which hospital has the highest number of patients? 
- What share of patients in the general hospital suffer from stomach-related issues? 
- What share of patients in the sports hospital suffer from dislocation-related issues? 
- What is the difference in the median ages of patients in the general and sports hospitals? 
- In which hospital was the blood test taken the most often, and how many blood tests were taken?
